**Predictive Maintenance using Machine Sound**
Project Overview

This project aims to predict the operational status (on or off) of a machine using audio data. This is a classic example of a binary classification task applied in the realm of predictive maintenance. The predictive model is trained to discern whether Machine 9 is operational based on the sound it produces.

Code Structure
The code for this project is primarily contained in a Jupyter notebook named Classifier2.ipynb. Here's a brief rundown of its structure:

Importing Libraries: The necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, audio processing, and machine learning model development are imported.

Data Loading: Audio files, which serve as the primary data source, are loaded from a designated directory. Each audio file is a recording of the machine's sound.

Feature Extraction: The Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) of the audio files are computed using the librosa library. These serve as the feature set for the machine learning model.

Label Extraction: Labels, which indicate whether the machine is on or off, are extracted directly from the audio filenames.

Data Preparation: The feature set and the labels are partitioned into a training set and a testing set.

Model Training: A neural network model is trained on the training set. The model architecture includes a flatten layer, a dense layer with a ReLU activation function, a dropout layer to prevent overfitting, and a final dense layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model is evaluated on the testing set.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed on your system:

os
pandas
numpy
librosa
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn.model_selection
tensorflow.keras.models
tensorflow.keras.layers
tensorflow.keras.optimizers

You can install these libraries using pip:

`pip install pandas numpy librosa matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow`

**Usage**

To use the model:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Make sure you have all the necessary Python libraries installed.
Place your audio files in the directory specified in the code.
Run the Jupyter notebook (Classifier2.ipynb).
The notebook is designed to be self-explanatory and should run without any issues given that the prerequisites are met.
